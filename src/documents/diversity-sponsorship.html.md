# Diversity Sponsorship


We aim to help underrepresented groups in tech to attend and lowering the barriers for them.
This includes but isn’t limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, and disabled people.
We would like to give them a chance.

To help them, we provide a **limited number of free, Diversity Supported tickets**.
Anyone can apply for a ticket, using this form, right now:

<div class="buy-tickets">
    <div class="ticket diversity-apply">
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nWzOFlQZgKmj2LmrnQ0X-LWeIrphFv9z4FyOqivAQ5k/viewform" class="buy-button" target="_blank">Apply now</a>
    </div>
</div>

These tickets are free for the applicants, but actually paid for, by our awesome generous partners,
without them this program could not exist. These private individuals, or companies paid for those tickets
that are available in the programme.

We, the organizers, do not decide who gets these tickets. We managed to assemble an international jury of individuals,
who work hard to improve diversity in tech. They will handle the awarding process, by choosing from the applications for the tickets.

The Jury:
- [Anika Lindtner](https://twitter.com/langziehohr) from [Travis Foundation](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/)
- [Karolina Szczur](https://twitter.com/fox), from [&yet](https://andyet.com/)
- [Szilvia Koleszár](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szkoleszar), founder of [SKOOL](http://skool.org.hu/en/)
