# Diversity Sponsorship


We would like this conference, to be available for everybody in the region.
Unfortunately there are people who still can't make it, because of some social, financial or medical disadvantagement.
We would like to give them a chance.
We also aim to help underrepresented groups in tech to attend and lowering the barriers for them.
This includes but isn’t limited to: e.g. women, people of color, people with disabilities, LGBT* people etc.

To help them, we provide a **limited number of free, Diversity Supported tickets**.
Anyone can apply for a ticket, using this form, right now:

<div class="buy-tickets">
    <div class="ticket diversity-apply">
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nWzOFlQZgKmj2LmrnQ0X-LWeIrphFv9z4FyOqivAQ5k/viewform" class="buy-button" target="_blank">Apply now</a>
    </div>
</div>

These tickets are free for the applicants, but actually paid for, by our awesome generous partners,
without them this program could not exist. These private individuals, or companies paid for those tickets
that are available in the programme.

We, the organizers, do not decide who gets these tickets. We managed to assemble an international jury of individuals,
who work hard to improve diversity in tech. They will handle the awarding process, by choosing from the applications for the tickets.

More information on the jury will follow soon. Stay tuned.
