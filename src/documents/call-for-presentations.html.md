# Call for Presentations

We are inviting the JavaScript community to submit talks for the upcoming JSConf Budapest <br />(May 14th-15th, Budapest). 

This Call for Presentation **closes on March 7th**.

Please read this, to get more info on our CFP, or just [skip to the form](#submit).

<a id="topics" ></a>

## Topics

We like to see anything that squarely fits into the spectrum of:

* Cutting-edge technological advances in the world of JavaScript or computer science in general, if somehow applicable to JavaScript.
* Crazy Ideas & Crazy Hacks.
* Culture, improving JavaScript developers’ lives.
* Mobile JS.
* Hardware JS.
* Fundamentals, in a modern light.
* And finally: Anything you want!

## We Can Help

Not everybody is a natural talent on stage. Not everybody can produce kick-ass slide-decks. Not everybody is a live-demo-god. 
Not everybody knows they have something great to talk about.

There are about a million reasons why *you* don’t consider yourself a speaker. **We are here to prove you wrong**. 
If all you have is a gut feeling that you should be on stage, we are here to reach out and help you to develop or hone the 
skills you think you lack to deliver a great presentation.

* We are happy to brainstorm your interests to see if a great topic is hiding.
* We are happy to connect you with experienced speakers to help prepare your submission
* We are happy to review and advise on how to produce a slide deck.
* If you need practice giving talks, get in touch, we can hook you up with local groups
* Again, *whatever* else you might need, we’re here to help.

Get in touch: [team@jsconfbp.com](mailto:team@jsconfbp.com)<br />
(just don’t use this to submit a proposal).

If you need more encouragement, check out JSConf EU organiser <br />
Tiffany’s site [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/) that tries to convince you to speak.

## The Perks 

If you get selected as a speaker at JSConf Budapest, here’s what you get:

* **Travel to Budapest covered.** This usually means we pay for your plane or train ticket. We are happy to assist with 
booking your itinerary, but if you can do it yourself, we can focus on making the conference more awesome.

* **Entrance to the conference.** We won’t be done with the speaker selections by the end of the ticket sales, 
so if you want to make sure you can attend, you may want to purchase a ticket regardless. If you get selected to speak and 
if you need to, we can refund your ticket, but if we don’t, we can spend more money on making the conference more awesome.

* **We cover your stay in Budapest** in a fancy hotel near the venue (including free Wifi) for the days of the conference, 
a day before, and the weekend after (i.e. May 13th-18th). If you want to stay longer, we can arrange things, just let us know. 
You will have to cover extra nights, though.

* If your employer can cover your travel and hotel, we are happy to list them as an awesome company sponsor. The money we save 
will be used to make the conference more awesome. (You might see a pattern …)

If you have any special requirements, non-return trips (say you are going to Fronteers as well), just let us know, we can 
usually work these things out. Just note that every minute we spend on this, we don't spend on making the conference more awesome ;)

If you want to bring a significant other, or bring your kid(s) and need child-care to be sorted out for the time of the conference, 
please also get in touch. We are here to make this easy for you!

## The Selection Process 

Here’s roughly how we pick our talks:

* Anonymize submissions, so we don’t bias against anything related to the submitter.
* Two rounds of voting:
 1. The first round rates each talk on a scale from 1 to 10.
 2. The top-N (~50) submissions are rated again on a 3-point scale (“meh”, “yay”, “MUST HAVE”).
* De-anonymize so we can (finally) bias against speaker details (based on our budget, we might opt for a local or at least 
closer-by (read: cheaper to transport) speaker).

(and a number of details that we make up as we go along)

<a id="guidelines" ></a>

## Guidelines 

Submit your proposal by **March 7th, 23:59:59 CEST**. <br />
No excuses.

All talks are **in English**.

**Talks are usually 30 minutes long** (for longer talks we’d get in touch with you directly). Afterwards, there is a 
rough 10 minutes of Q&A. We will be on a tight schedule and enforce the end of a talk rigorously. 
We suggest timing your presentation in advance.

**Make sure you care**, and make sure we see you care. Typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase submissions make our 
reading of your proposal tedious. These things will definitely count against your proposal.

**Don’t overdo it** either. If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your topic, we need to ask you 
to slim things down. With the amount of submissions we get, the quicker you can to make a good impression, the better.

**Original Topics**. One of the things we like to do with JSConf Budapest is to push the community forward. We can’t do 
this if the same people keep talking about the same things all the time. Thus, we favour original content. If you want 
to discuss a topic that you have talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist, or new research, or development, something 
unique. Of course, if your talk is plain awesome as-is, go for that :)

<a id="misc" ></a>

## Misc 

All talks will be recorded and published on the internet for free, along with a recording of the slide deck, live-demo or 
other on-presenter-screen activity.

We do this for the benefit of the larger JS community and those who can’t make it to the conference. We hope you want to 
help out, but if you are in any way uncomfortable in any way, let us know and we will work things out.

Finally, since you retain full ownership of your slides and recording, we’d like to ask you to make your materials and 
recording available under a creative commons (we default to no commercial reuse) or other open source license.
