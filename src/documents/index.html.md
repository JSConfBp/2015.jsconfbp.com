    <h3>
        JavaScript for Virtual Reality
    </h3>
    <p>
        Is 2015 the year of Virtual Reality? Experts suggest that VR will be a 5.2B industry within the next 2 years -
        but right now, the majority of VR development tools require heavy game engines and specialized desktops.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this talk, we'll discuss the emerging support from Google & Mozilla for WebVR, a new API emerging to support
        writing VR-enabled websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll be taking a look at existing applications
        for virtual reality on the web, the benefits of WebVR, and how to get started with the available tools and
        libraries for browser-based virtual reality written in JavaScript.

    <h3>
        The web is getting pushy
    </h3>
    <p>
        The battle between native and web rages on. The browsers are fighting hard to tear down the benefits that native
        developers have relied on since the inception of mobile platforms. Geolocation, sorted. Accelerometer, done.
        Performance, we'll come back to that. But one of the greatest draws for native developers has been push notifications,
        for the web,<br /> email alerts just don't cut it.
    </p>

    <p>
        But now, new in browsers for 2015, is the Service Worker. Born out of the struggle to make the Appcache work
        for offline capable sites it has also brought the advent of push notifications to the web. Through building
        up an example application live we will see how to implement the Service Worker to not only serve up an app when
        we're offline but enhance the online experience with push notifications.
    </p>

    <p>
        The battle may continue, but the web is definitely pushing back.

    <h3>
        We fail to follow SemVer – and why it needn’t matter
    </h3>
    <p>
        If extensive libraries and even the tiniest module followed SemVer strictly, dependency hell would be a thing of the past … but humans weren’t made to follow rules.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are over 125.000 packages on npm today. By the time of this conference, at least another 10.000 will have been added. Using the right packages in your own modules and applications makes JavaScript the joy to develop it is today. But if even immensely popular libraries fail to properly declare breaking changes, how can we trust the over 50.000 strangers who developed all these modules?
        Currently we can’t. Let me show you how to write confidence-inspiring modules by leaving package publishing up to the machines – instead of buggy humans.

        Dancing with Robots
    </h3>
    <p>
        Web apps are great and everything, but imagine using JS to fly drones and make them dance to the sounds of dubstep!
        Or to control disco lights and other robots! Sounds fun, right? In this talk, we will not only explore
        how we can write code to make this possible, but it will also be full of exciting, interactive (and possibly dangerous ;) ) demos!

        How you can fix your community in one day
    </h3>
    <p>
        This talk will teach you a magic trick.
    </p>
    <p>
        It will show you to stop our communities from breaking apart. Studies have shown that half the women who enter the technology field will over time leave. HALF! What’s happening? How did we get here? What can we do?
    </p>
    <p>
        In my talk I will show you how we can fix the diversity problem, and why we should care. I'll tell you a true story about about role models, broken stereotypes - and cat gifs.
    </p>
    <p>
        How to build community-driven initiatives that change our world. And the best part is: Everyone can do it. In one day.

    <h3>
        Functional UIs and Unidirectional Dataflow
    </h3>
    <p>
        Let us bring back the days where we could write declarative representations of how we want our UI components to work. We should be able to read our code from top to bottom and intuitively know what the output will be, just like the good old HTML, but with the power of functional programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this talk we'll explore bringing functional programming into views. Instead of moving logic to markup through weird DSLs we bring expressive views into the programming language. We'll see how to create a UI where we have composable, pure and referentially transparent components; components with no side-effects and predictable output. We couple this with immutable data and components with single responsibilities, and we can get a fast and smart way to build UIs with a unidirectional flow and a simpler static mental model.

    </h3>
    <p>
        Because dependency injection is cool and that it makes life of all us developers a looot easier,
        we start off this talk by first understanding what dependency injection stands for and why it is
        such a blessing in disguise...and also because first things first. Once that is clear we can dive
        deeper into some existing implementations, to get a real feel of how it all works,
        and finish by looking at how these implementations are used inside the new Angular 2,
        by embracing the power of TypeScript annotations.

[Uránia Cinema in the middle of the city](https://goo.gl/maps/FB2r9), near the party-district. Designed by Henrik Schmahl in the late 1890's, the interior is
characterized by the ornamental motifs of the Venetian Gothic and Moor styles. The place is listed as the [world's 3rd most beautiful cinema on
Bored Panda](http://www.boredpanda.com/urania-national-film-theatre-budapest-hungary/), and many tech conferences were hosted here recently, like **TEDx**,
and Strech Conference, because of the unique atmosphere.
