            Asynchronous JavaScript at Netflix
        </h3>
    </div>
    <span class="image"><img src="/images/speaker-matthew.png" /></span>
    <p>
       What’s does a mouse drag event have in common with an Array of numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
       The answer to this question may surprise you: they are both collections.
    </p>
    <p>
       This key insight holds the key to dramatically simplifying asynchronous programming in JavaScript. In this talk you will learn how you can use the familiar JavaScript Array methods to create surprisingly expressive asynchronous programs.
    </p>
    <p>
       Using just a few functions, you will learn how to do the following:
    </p>
     <ul>
               <li>Declaratively build complex events out of simple events (ex. drag n’ drop)</li>
               <li>Coordinate and sequence multiple Ajax requests</li>
               <li>Reactively update UI’s in response to data changes</li>
               <li>Eliminate memory leaks caused by neglecting to unsubscribe from events</li>
               <li>Gracefully propagate and handle asynchronous exception</li>
           </ul>
    <p>
       In this talk we’ll be exploring the Reactive Extensions (RxJS) library (http://github.com/reactive-extensions/RxJS), which allows us to treat events as collections. You’ll learn about how Netflix uses Rx on the client and the server, allowing us to build end-to-end reactive systems. We’ll also contrast Rx with Promises, another popular approach to building asynchronous programs in JavaScript.

            JavaScript for Virtual Reality
        </h3>
    </div>
    <span class="image"><img src="/images/speaker-liv.png" /></span>
    <p>
        Is 2015 the year of Virtual Reality? Experts suggest that VR will be a 5.2B industry within the next 2 years -
        but right now, the majority of VR development tools require heavy game engines and specialized desktops.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this talk, we'll discuss the emerging support from the VR and web communities for WebVR, a new API emerging
        to support writing VR-enabled websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll be taking a look at existing applications
        for virtual reality on the web, the benefits of WebVR, and how to get started with the available tools and
        libraries for browser-based virtual reality written in JavaScript.

            The web is getting pushy
        </h3>
    </div>
    <span class="image"><img src="/images/speaker-philnash.jpg" /></span>
    <p>
        The battle between native and web rages on. The browsers are fighting hard to tear down the benefits that native
        developers have relied on since the inception of mobile platforms. Geolocation, sorted. Accelerometer, done.
        Performance, we'll come back to that. But one of the greatest draws for native developers has been push notifications,
        for the web,<br /> email alerts just don't cut it.
    </p>

    <p>
        But now, new in browsers for 2015, is the Service Worker. Born out of the struggle to make the Appcache work
        for offline capable sites it has also brought the advent of push notifications to the web. Through building
        up an example application live we will see how to implement the Service Worker to not only serve up an app when
        we're offline but enhance the online experience with push notifications.
    </p>

    <p>
        The battle may continue, but the web is definitely pushing back.

    <span class="image"><img src="/images/speaker-stephan.jpeg" /></span>
    <p>
        If extensive libraries and even the tiniest module followed SemVer strictly, dependency hell would be a thing of the past … but humans weren’t made to follow rules.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are over 125.000 packages on npm today. By the time of this conference, at least another 10.000 will have been added. Using the right packages in your own modules and applications makes JavaScript the joy to develop it is today. But if even immensely popular libraries fail to properly declare breaking changes, how can we trust the over 50.000 strangers who developed all these modules?
        Currently we can’t. Let me show you how to write confidence-inspiring modules by leaving package publishing up to the machines – instead of buggy humans.

        Web apps are great and everything, but imagine using JS to fly drones and make them dance to the sounds of dubstep!
        Or to control disco lights and other robots! Sounds fun, right? In this talk, we will not only explore
        how we can write code to make this possible, but it will also be full of exciting, interactive (and possibly dangerous ;) ) demos!

        It will show you to stop our communities from breaking apart. Studies have shown that half the women who enter the technology field will over time leave. HALF! What’s happening? How did we get here? What can we do?
    </p>
    <p>
        In my talk I will show you how we can fix the diversity problem, and why we should care. I'll tell you a true story about about role models, broken stereotypes - and cat gifs.

    <span class="image"><img src="/images/speaker-brevik.png" /></span>

    <p>
        Let us bring back the days where we could write declarative representations of how we want our UI components to work. We should be able to read our code from top to bottom and intuitively know what the output will be, just like the good old HTML, but with the power of functional programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this talk we'll explore bringing functional programming into views. Instead of moving logic to markup through weird DSLs we bring expressive views into the programming language. We'll see how to create a UI where we have composable, pure and referentially transparent components; components with no side-effects and predictable output. We couple this with immutable data and components with single responsibilities, and we can get a fast and smart way to build UIs with a unidirectional flow and a simpler static mental model.

[Uránia Cinema in the middle of the city](https://goo.gl/maps/FB2r9), near the party-district. Designed by Henrik Schmahl in the late 1890's, the interior is
characterized by the ornamental motifs of the Venetian Gothic and Moor styles. The place is listed as the [world's 3rd most beautiful cinema on
Bored Panda](http://www.boredpanda.com/urania-national-film-theatre-budapest-hungary/), and many tech conferences were hosted here recently, like **TEDx**,
and Strech Conference, because of the unique atmosphere.

# Party
