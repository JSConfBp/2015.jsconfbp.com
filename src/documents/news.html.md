        <h3>Diversity Sponsorship Programme</h3>

        <p>
            From today we start our Diversity Sponsorship programme, until the ticket sales is still on.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have a <strong>batch of free tickets</strong>, dedicated for underrepresented groups in tech,
            who cannot attend the conference for some reason.
            <br />
            For these tickets, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nWzOFlQZgKmj2LmrnQ0X-LWeIrphFv9z4FyOqivAQ5k/viewform">anyone
            can send in application, using this form</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
           This programme could not be started without our awesome launch partners:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Travis CI</li>
            <li>npm Inc</li>
            <li>Maciej Małecki</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You can join this hall of fame, by buying a <a href="https://ti.to/jsconf-bp/jsconfbp2015/with/g28801bswls">Diversity Supporter ticket</a>,
            or a <a href="https://ti.to/jsconf-bp/jsconfbp2015/with/2swarhzckgc">Diversity Sponsorship package</a> on Tito.
        </p>

        <p>
            With this programme we also rewised our Diversity Supporter ticket, and removed the option from the ticket
            holder to name the beneficiary. From now on, the second ticket in the price will be assigned to the batch
            of free tickets for applicants.
        </p>
